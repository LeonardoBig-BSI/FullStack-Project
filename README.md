In this project, contains some technologies and tools that were essential from the beginning to the end of the application. I will list them below:
- TypeScript.
- NodeJS.
- MongoDB Atlas as a NoSQL database.
- Prisma Client -> Next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), designed to simplify database management in applications, allowing you to interact with your database in an easy and secure way using a programmatic API.
- Fastify -> route-based, where routes are defined using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- TailwindCSS -> Utility-first CSS framework that allows for the quick and customized creation of user interfaces (UI).
- Axios -> A popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) in the browser and in Node.js.




# :hammer: How To Use
1. In order for the application to communicate with MongoDB, it is necessary to obtain the connection string (containing your username and password). This information should be stored in a .env file. An important point is that this file should be listed in the .gitignore file for better data security.
2. As soon as you open the backend or frontend folder, run the following command to download all the necessary packages listed in the project:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
  
3. To run the BackEnd and FrontEnd applications:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
